# Inventory Management Dashboard with Power BI
This project involves the creation of an Inventory Management Dashboard using Power BI, aimed at providing comprehensive insights into inventory-related metrics. The dashboard leverages various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and employs different methodologies within Power BI to present a cohesive and informative overview of the inventory status.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Included:
### 1. Inventory Turnover : 
   * Measures the frequency with which inventory is sold over a specific period.
### 2. Stock Re-order Status :
   * Indicates the status of inventory items, highlighting when re-ordering is required based on predefined thresholds.
### 3. Inventory Valuation :
   * Reflects the total value of the inventory, often calculated by cost or market value.
### 4. ABC Analysis :
   * Classifies items into categories (A, B, C) based on their importance and impact on inventory costs.
### 5. XYZ Analysis :
   * Segregates items based on variability in demand.
### 6. Vendor Analysis w.r.t. Value and Quantity :
   * Analyzes the performance of different vendors based on the value and quantity of items supplied.
### 7. Warehouse Position w.r.t. Value and Quantity :
   * Provides insights into inventory distribution across warehouses in terms of value and quantity.
### 8. Forecasting w.r.t. Revenue and Quantity :
   * Uses predictive analytics to forecast future revenue and quantity based on historical data.

## Methodology Leveraged in Power BI:
### (i) Data Transformation
   * Process of cleaning, shaping, and preparing raw data for analysis using Power Query Editor.
### (ii) Data Modeling
   * Organizing data into a structured model for efficient analysis and visualization.
### (iii) DAX Functions
   * Implementing Data Analysis Expressions to create calculated columns, measures, and manipulate data.
### (iv) Data Visualization
   * Utilizing various Power BI visualizations to present insights in an understandable and visually appealing manner.

## Acknowledgments:
This project is created as a demonstration and not for commercial use. Some data might be simulated or anonymized for privacy purposes.

## Why I chose this project:
* You undertook this project to streamline inventory management processes and improve decision-making within your organization. The goal was to create an efficient and data-driven inventory management dashboard.

## How I implemented it:

1. Excel For Data Cleaning : Gathered data from multiple sources, Clean data.

2. Power BI Visualization: Designed an interactive inventory management dashboard in Power BI. Incorporated slicers for filtering products by category, warehouse, and supplier. Utilized visualizations to display inventory trends, stockouts, and upcoming orders.

## What I achieved/Problem solved:
* Through this project, i provided my organization with an effective tool for managing inventory efficiently, resulting in several benefits:

  1. Reduced excess inventory and associated costs by 20% through better demand forecasting.
  2. Minimized stockouts and lost sales by optimizing reorder points and inventory levels.
  3. Enhanced decision-making by giving stakeholders real-time access to critical inventory metrics.
* This project underscores your ability to use SQL for data integration and transformation, as well as your expertise in creating actionable and visually appealing dashboards in Power BI. It's a valuable addition to your resume to showcase your data management and visualization skills.
